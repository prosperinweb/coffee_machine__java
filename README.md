# Machine Inventory Project Learnings

While coding this Java project, I learned the following concepts and techniques:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The project is structured around the `MachineInventory` class, demonstrating the principles of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Methods and Control Structures**: The project involved writing various methods and using control structures like `if-else` and `switch` statements. This helped in understanding how to control the flow of a program.

3. **Java I/O**: The project used the `Scanner` class for taking user input, providing practical experience with Java's I/O capabilities.

4. **Java Formatting**: The `printf` function was used to format the output, which helped in understanding how to display formatted data in Java.

5. **State Management**: The project involved managing the state of the coffee machine (water, milk, coffee beans, cups, and money), demonstrating how to maintain and update the state of an object in Java.

6. **Gradle**: The project used Gradle as a build tool, providing experience with building and managing Java projects using Gradle.


## Future Improvement Goals

1. **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests to ensure the functionality of the application and prevent regression bugs.

2. **Exception Handling**: Improve the robustness of the application by adding comprehensive exception handling.

3. **User Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the application more user-friendly.

4. **Database Integration**: Integrate a database to store the state of the machine, allowing for persistent data storage.

5. **Concurrency**: Implement multi-threading to allow multiple operations to be performed simultaneously.

6. **Code Refactoring**: Refactor the code to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance.
